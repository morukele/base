# Base Layer

> _The project depends on C Runtime for getting started_

A base layer for C++ development. The goal is to have reusable code for other projects. The project has no OS dependencies and no external dependencies.

The base consists of:

- Assert
- ArrayCount
- IntFromPtr (casting)
- PtrFromInt (casting)
- Member (memory pointer)
- OffsetOfMember (memory address)
- Maximum
- Minimum
- Clamp (between)
- ClampTop (top)
- ClampBot (bottom)
- C-style linkage
- Memory Zero functions
- Memory Copy functions
